      <h1>Complaints</h1>
      <p class="p">Most people in the world utter a complaint about 15 to 30 times in one day! It can be pretty tempting to complain. Of course, if we are being complained at, then we notice and find fault in the person, indubitably, we do not realize that we complain just as much as they do, perchance even more! How in the world are we supposed to get out of this habit?!? Knowledge forevermore assists. Complaints are invisible. Faith, prayer, and fasting are your leading contingent to destroying this misdemeanor. Allright! Let’s plunge into the imperceptible habit of complaining.</p>
      <p class="p">Learning about the weakness you have is a brilliant way to overcome it. Complaining is just a way of getting others to also feel the pain, but telling people you are in pain is not complaining. Complaining is carrying on and on and exaggerating about the pain you feel. This can go as far as blaming other people for your sin. You complain that they made you do it or whatever, even though you have the free will to say no. Imagine how much power Satan must have if he can get 8.3 billion people to complain 15 to 30 times a day. We must try to suppress his power and stop complaining!</p>
      <p class="p">Complaints are completely unforeseen by the person who says them, nor are they seen after they utter them. I mentioned earlier to think of Satan’s power. Add to your imagination, the true statement: We are in the habit of complaining. We cannot get out of this habit, not without strict watch over our tongue. We receive the Holy Eucharist on this tongue, we cannot have it disheveled with complaints! Remember every venial sin we commit, we come to be weaker to resist mortal sins. Watch for those devious complaints!</p>
      <p class="p">I once saw “Faith is the key, but prayer unlocks the door.” I disagree. Faith is the door and prayer is the key, but fasting unlocks that door to heaven. Have faith that the Lord wants you to overcome this habit and trust that He will help you. Pray to Jesus and Mary, both of whom were completely free from sin while in this world. They will help you. However, we cannot reap what we do not sow. We have to put in effort to save and defend our souls. Fasting is a great way to fill this gap. When we fast, we tell God that we love Him more than anything on Earth, including food, water, and oxygen! Thus, God rewards us for trying hard to save our souls and bestows more graces on us. Faith, prayer, and fasting are the best ways to get over this misdemeanor and save our souls.</p>
      <p class="p">Once again, turning to the saints’ example will help us to overcome our vices. Everyone struggles with complaints, but here are a few saints, who especially had a personality for complaining: St. Jerome, St. Thérèse of Lisieux (the Little Flower), St. Damien of Molokai, and St. Paul. Like all saints, these ones are excellent examples to follow. Look them up and read about their lives! 500 words, one point: Stop complaining!</p>
