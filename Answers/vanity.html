      <h1>Vanity</h1>
      <p class="p">Vanity is an offense against God. But what is vanity? Vanity is acknowledging that we’re beautiful. This can be a good thing, but however, when we commit vanity, we go too far. First, we are beautifully made. Second, we cannot think we are more beautiful than others. Third, vanity is a serious sin. Thus, by committing vanity we are hurting God and killing Christ on the cross.</p>
      <p class="p">Acknowledging that we’re beautiful is vital to get to heaven. If we do not acknowledge this, we can fall into the sins of despair and scrupulosity. For we are all beautifully made by God, for God, and with God. Knowing this, we can thank God for all he has done for us. Simply acknowledging that God made us beautiful is not the sin of vanity.</p>
      <p class="p">I cannot be more beautiful than you, just as you cannot be more beautiful than anyone else. Everyone is unique, yet God still made everyone equal. We are all equally beautiful, for we are all made in the image and likeness of our majestically, gorgeous Creator. However, just as we can get dirty and less beautiful (in the world’s eyes) on the outside, so our souls can get muddy too. No matter what sin we commit and no matter what dirt we get on our souls, we are made equally beautiful. If we get more dirt on our souls than others, it may appear that we are less beautiful. We are all equally beautiful, just as the colors <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> and <span style="color: #FFD700;">yellow</span> are equally beautiful.</p>
      <p class="p">Vanity is often a death to the soul, a mortal sin, a turning away from God. By being vanitous, we are telling God that we are beautiful out of makeup or dresses, rather than because God made us beautiful. We are literally causing the agony in the Garden, betraying the Son of Man with a kiss, arresting and coming up with false accusations to kill Him, we are grabbing a whip with three metal balls on the end and striking mercilessly, we are shoving a crown of thorns on His most precious head, we are condemning Him to die, we are sending Him up a hill to His deathplace, we are nailing Him to the Cross, we are saying, “If Thou are’t the Son of God, show us and come down from that Cross!”, we are piercing His side with a lance. Still, after doing all these things, we feel no or little regret. When we hog a mirror to admire ourselves, we are doing two things: We are not letting others use that same mirror and we are being vanitous.</p>
      <p class="p">We now finally see what happens to our poor Savior when we are vanitous. Saint Teresa of Àvila (or Saint Teresa of Jesus) struggled with vanity, but managed to overcome it. More saints who also struggled are St. Rose of Lima, St. Ignatius of Loyola, and St. Bernedette. These are highly recommended saints for any who tend to struggle with vanity and pride.  Five hundred words, one point: Be Not Vanitous!</p>
